[2007-08-09] Akita
  * Added ajaxometer.ping file to be fetched during our ping test instead
    of ajaxometer.php?len=1, this should help with the extremely high latency
    caused from php/cgi configurations.

[2007-04-05] Akita 
  * Added check so that we don't reallocate our upload data if we already have
    chunk of data the same size. This should fix some IE out of memory issues
    when we are running tests on 'fast' networks (e.g., Gb lans..).
  * Added min/max number of calibration steps to ensure we don't sit around
    forever trying to calibrate. 
  * Added max upload/download sizes.. ones max upload size should be tuned to
    the maximum post size for your server. 

[2006-11-20] Akita - 0.9.2 released

[2006-11-20] Akita 
  * Put in some basic compensation for jittery/spiky servers.

[2006-11-20] Akita 
  * Fixed rate display so it doesn't show Bb/s when we get a crazy slow rating.
