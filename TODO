* Need to do more checking for svg capabilities and error out if such things
  are not present (or better yet, have a fallback speed test... but,
  whatever..)

  Specifically: We need to do appropriate checks in Saffari, but seeing as how
  I don't have access to a mac, I can't test, so until someone comes along and
  wants to help contribute, mac users will need to figure out that they need
  the adobe svg plugin on their own. (or use firefox or opera or something of the sort) 

* Maybe need to add multi-lingual support. Anyone want to volunteer?
