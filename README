0. About
========

  AJAXOmeter is a web-based bandwidth testing utility implemented in PHP, SVG,
  and JavaScript. It tests http-request latency and upload/download speeds to
  the web server. 

  The AJAXOmeter project is released under a BSD style license, the license
  details are located in the LICENSE file you should have received with this
  distribution. 


1. Installation
===============
  
  Simply place the five ajaxometer.* files in your desired directory and point
  the user to ajaxometer.php

  
2. Modifying & Embedding
========================

  AJAXOmeter can be easily embedded inside another web page by simply embedding
  the SVG document into your desired page. (See ajaxometer.php for an example).
  The ajaxometer.php file is still required since the JavaScript code still
  makes requests to ajaxometer.php, but this way the user doesn't ever have
  to see ajaxometer.php on their URL.

  The .js and .php files have some configuration options located at the top of
  the file you can tweak if you so desire. Other modifications will probably
  require a fairly good understanding of SVG and JavaScript.
